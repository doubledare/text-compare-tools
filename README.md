This package was developed using the Meteorite command wrapper for Meteor. https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite

Once you have Meteorite and Meteor installed then cd into this package and simply run

	'mrt'

on the command line. This will run the test server on localhost on the default port 3000.

Open this in your favourite browser to see the tests run.

The tests will autorun if any files are changed.
